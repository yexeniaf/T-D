T & D 

## Project Description

This will be a Tappas and Drinks app where the person can find a drink that they wish to make. The second part will be for them to get a random tappas or snack that they can make so it can go along with their drink. 

## API and Data Sample

I am using two API's for my app, the first one is for making cocktails (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), I will be setting it up so the user can search by name.  



The Second one will be ( https://developer.edamam.com/) so it can give a random snack that can go with their drink that they looked up. 


## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Dec 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Complete
|Dec 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Dec 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Dec 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Dec 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Dec 16| MVP | Incomplete
|Dec 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
